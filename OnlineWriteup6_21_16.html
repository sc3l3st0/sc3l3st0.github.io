<blockquote>
  <p><strong>WHAT’S GOING ON, YA CRAZY NERD?  YOU SAID AGES AGO YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE THE WEBSITE DONE BY NOW!</strong> <br>
  I’ve been prototyping the website, but I keep getting new ideas, and so all the time I’m losing now is going to save me time later on.  If you’re wondering why you don’t have my handwritten/handdrawn notes, it’s because I wouldn’t want to put anyone through the attempt to understand my handwriting, let alone the weird shorthand I use. <br>
  <strong>CAN’T I HAVE SOMETHING FROM THE WEBSITE?  SEE WHERE YOU’RE AT?</strong> <br>
  Sure, weird, angry voice in my head.</p>

<p>So, VoiceMale does the following things online at the moment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>We’ve got <a href="http://www.brandeisvoicemale.com">a website</a>.</strong> That’s good for people who aren’t in VoiceMale, and want to access information or media from VoiceMale, or contact us for some reason.  At the moment it’s slow, and out-dated both in terms of facts and technology.  We use this for:</p>

<ul><li><strong>“News,”</strong> although no one would call the current selection “new.”</li>
<li><strong>Group history</strong></li>
<li><strong>“Current” group members</strong></li>
<li><strong>“Current” set</strong></li>
<li><strong>Contact information</strong></li>
<li><strong>Information about albums</strong> and <strong>purchase links</strong></li>
<li><strong>Alumni information</strong></li>
<li><strong>Links to social media and YouTube</strong></li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>We’ve got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRUrd9nIXd_lcNQwp7e2eTw">a YouTube page</a>.</strong> That’s good for people who want to see us perform live, to see how good we <em>“really”</em> are.  It’s not very good for people who want to see music videos, but that’s another story.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We’ve got <a href="https://web.groupme.com/chats">a group chat</a>.</strong> That’s good for people who are in VoiceMale, and want to communicate.  This is free and easy to use, so it doesn’t matter much for the purposes of this document.  We use this for:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Rehearsal announcements</strong></li>
<li><strong>Performance discussion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arrangement discussion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Job assignments for various tasks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Day-to-day scheduling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dank memes</strong></li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>We’ve got <a href="https://www.mediafire.com">a hosting service</a>.</strong> This is where it starts to get messy, since the hosting service, although it’s free, is by no means designed with us in mind.  We use this for:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Arrangement PDFs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Part Recordings</strong></li>
<li><strong>Photos</strong></li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>We’ve got <a href="http://brandeisvoicemale.pbworks.com/">a wiki</a>.</strong> Some VoiceMale members don’t even know how to use the damn thing.  There’s stuff on it, but it’s quite out of date at this point.  We use this for:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Song selection</strong></li>
<li><strong>Outdated storage for VoiceMale documents</strong>, e.g. the constitution, documents for specific roles, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Some media storage</strong></li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Alumni have <a href="http://suchow.io/voicemale/">archives</a>.</strong> These are really useful for historical purposes, but they’re hard to use without messaging alums and finding them and it’s quite a hassle in general because they’re not provided at the discretion of people currently in the group. This can be used for:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Finding old recordings</strong></li>
<li><strong>Finding old arrangements</strong></li>
<li><strong>Finding old media</strong></li>
<li><strong>Finding old documents</strong></li></ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/brandeisvoicemale/?fref=ts">We’ve</a> got <a href="https://twitter.com/brandeisvm">social</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brandeisvoicemale/">media</a>.</strong> This is good for reaching out to people who aren’t in VoiceMale, and wouldn’t think to go to the website.</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?  I KNEW ALL THAT ALREADY!</strong> <br>
  Hush.  Patience.</p>

<p><strong>The idea of having a webmaster is kinda dumb if you think about it.</strong> What does a webmaster do?  He handles the online stuff when it breaks, and tries to set up everything in a way that it works smoothly.  But if the stuff is already set up in a way that works smoothly, and breaks very rarely, there’s no need for a webmaster, except every few years when your shit stops working smoothly and everyone else is using brand-spanking new technology.  My goal here is to try and set VoiceMale up so that <strong>we don’t need a webmaster for the next six years.</strong></p>

<p>You might have noticed there were a bunch of websites in the here and now bit.  I believe that if possible we should have as few websites to manage as possible.  This will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Save VoiceMale members time and effort</li>
<li>Minimize the numbers of websites we have to check to find an answer</li>
<li>Be easier for us to manage</li>
<li>Be designed in such a way that we get more information online in less time</li>
</ul>

<p>This is how I’d like our web system to be designed:</p>

  <p><strong>HOW AM I EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND THAT?  IT’S SOOOO LOOOOOOOONG!</strong> <br>
  I arranged it in interest order.  So like, start at the top and read the public stuff, and then after you get past “Private -&gt; Functions,” it’s mostly stuff for individuals, who I can talk to individually. <br>
  <strong>I DO[N’T] THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE… [SUCH AND SUCH]!</strong> <br>
  Very specific.  That’s kind of the point of this document. <br>
  <strong>OH. WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> <br>
  I actually don’t know, given that you’re a figment of my imagination. <br>
  <strong>HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY GET ALL THIS DONE IN ONE SUMMER?</strong> <br>
  Good question.  Keep reading.</p>

<p>Right, so this isn’t going to happen all in one stage.  Obviously, there is currently a need for a webmaster.  I intend to fill the role until I’ve finished the entire web system, at which point I’ll consider my job done.  Here’s an approximate timeline:</p>

<ul>
<li>Next month or so: <br>
<ul><li>Finish public website</li>
<li>Get that online</li></ul></li>
<li>Over the summer: <br>
<ul><li>Phase out MediaFire and get the arrangements system online</li>
<li>Handle all other management tasks myself</li></ul></li>
<li>As the year begins: <br>
<ul><li>Add all management programs</li>
<li>Fill archive</li></ul></li>
<li>Moving forward: <br>
<ul><li>Optimize, debug, and make sure everything works in the long term</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>WAIT, WAIT, HOW DO YOU GET THIS THING ONLINE?</strong> <br>
  That’s another good question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Web Hosting is pretty cool, but it can be pretty complicated.  You need the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>website name</strong> (in our case, <a href="http://www.brandeisvoicemale.com">brandeisvoicemale.com</a>)</li>
<li>A <strong>server</strong> that runs all the time</li>
<li>“<strong>Back end</strong>” website files that secretly work in the background but don’t show up to a web browser</li>
<li>“<strong>Front end</strong>” website files that do show up to a web browser</li>
<li>Something called a <strong>DNS server</strong>, which tells a web browser that the website name should direct to the server</li>
<li>Something called an <strong>SSL certificate</strong>, which verifies the website’s identity if you want to make online payments anything else that requires security</li>
</ul>

<p>For pretty much all of these things, there are <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">free</a>, <a href="https://www.sslcertificate.com/">cheap</a>, and <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/ssl/ev-ssl/">expensive</a> ways to do them.  In general, the more you pay, the better you can get your shit to turn out.  So, if you want all the things I listed above, we gon need</p>

<h1 id="dat-cash-yo"><a href="http://philipinashoppingcart.com"><strong><em>DAT CASH YO</em></strong></a></h1>

<p>So right.  How much of dat cash yo am I talking about?  Well, that depends on the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>We already have a website name and a DNS server, and they’re perfectly legitimate, so that’s all good. (well, there is a fee for the name every few years, but it’s not much)</li>
<li>Most “front end” software is free and will work the same no matter what you’re paying, so that’s all good.</li>
<li>If we want to add payment to the website, there are <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/">free options</a> for SSL certificates which will work just fine for something as small as us, so that’s all good.</li>
<li>“Back end” software depends on the server.</li>
<li>The server depends on the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I totally lied.  It only depends on the server.</p>

<p>So how much of dat cash yo are we talking about for the server?  Well, there are several options:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Static” hosting: <a href="https://github.com/">Totally free!</a> But the whole website is open to the public, and you can’t have any of the private features I talked about, and there’s a permanent need for a webmaster who knows how to program.</li>
<li>Unreliable “Shared hosting:” Can be but <a href="https://www.hosting24.com/">isn’t always</a> very cheap, but is always <a href="http://www.biz.nf/co.nf-domain.php">extremely</a> unreliable, and your site can be <a href="http://purplewalrus.co.nf">shut down</a>.  This would limit how many users we could have without going down, as well as just about everything else.</li>
<li>Reliable “Shared hosting:” Starts at about <a href="https://www.webhosting.ninja/web-hosting">12 bucks a year</a>.  <strong>This is my third favorite option.</strong>  They probably won’t shut down your site.  Still quite unreliable though.  This would limit archive capabilities, as well as other private features I talked about. </li>
<li>“Virtual Private Server” hosting: Starts at about <a href="https://hostus.us/openvz-vps.html">24 bucks a year</a>.  <strong>This is my second favorite option.</strong> Quite reliable, but limited in terms of file space and RAM.</li>
<li>“On-Demand” hosting: Starts at about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">24 bucks a year</a>, but will <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">most likely be more</a>.  <strong>This is my favorite option.</strong>  Extremely reliable, and unlimited system specifications.  As you use more stuff, you pay more.</li>
<li>“Make Your Own Website!” systems: Hundreds of dollars a month, unless a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/elan.wong.1">friendly alumni</a> is paying.  <strong>This is <a href="http://www.webydo.com/">what we use right now</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">what everyone uses</a>.</strong>  Can be reliable, but are always canned.</li>
<li>“Dedicated” hosting: Ranges from hundreds to thousands of dollars a year.  This means you literally own a server and are paying somebody to store it and manage it and keep it connected.</li>
<li>“Super Legit” hosting: A whole bunch, then not much.  This is where you buy the server and connect it to the internet yourself.  Trust me, it’s <em>totally</em> called “Super Legit” hosting.</li>
<li>“Hire a Professional” systems: Don’t want to worry about any of this?  Hire a professional!  We’re only talking hundreds of dollars an hour.  And don’t worry, <a href="http://www.maccabeats.com/">it always turns out great</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve heard two points so far regarding money:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do what you think is best</li>
<li>Do it as cheap as possible</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, <strong>my preferred scenario is a budget of about 35 bucks per year</strong> for all online activities, which would be mostly put into server costs, and then I’d fork the budget personally for domain renewal as well as any surplus usage fees.</p>

<p>That being said, <strong>for anything less than that budget, I can produce a working product.</strong> It will, however, <strong>greatly affect the end result.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>BUT I DIDN’T CARE ABOUT THAT!</strong> <br>
  Sorry, too late. <br>
  <strong>IS THIS SOME KIND OF PROPOSAL?</strong> <br>
  Nope, just me describing the situation as I see it.</p>
